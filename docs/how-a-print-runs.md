# How a print runs

The mod is built so that **the same file prints on both firmwares**. A stock
FlashForge Orca profile, untouched, and files you sliced before you flashed:
they run here without a re-slice and without a line pasted into Machine start
G-code.

That is not a coincidence, and it is worth understanding if you intend to
change anything — because the reason it works is that something now does, in
Klipper, what FlashForge's application used to do outside it.

---

## Why the same file works

A FlashForge Orca profile is written for a machine whose touchscreen has
already prepared it. Its start block heats without waiting, runs fans, and
makes `G1 Z5 F2400` its first motion — on axes nothing has homed. There is no
`G28` in it and no `M190`. On stock that is fine: the app homed, soaked the
bed and grabbed the first tool before the file was ever handed to Klipper.

Delete the app and that file is dangerous. So `[ff_print]` takes over
`SDCARD_PRINT_FILE` and `M23`, reads the bed and nozzle temperatures, the
first tool, the tools the file uses and the first-layer height **out of the
file itself**, and runs the whole preparation before the file's first line
executes.

The file did not change. What changed is that the preparation moved from an
application nobody else could talk to into Klipper macros anyone can read.

## The two flows

**Stock, driven by the touchscreen:**

```
touchscreen: pick a file, Print
  │
  ├─ app: prepareForEddy ──── home, probe checks, heat bed + chamber,
  │                           tool-presence gate, nozzle clean per tool,
  │                           5-minute soak, re-home Z, bed mesh, grab tool
  ├─ app: absolute Z offset ─ the ~3.2 mm eddy-to-nozzle gap, once per print
  └─ app: serialPrint ─────── M21 → M23 → M26 S0 → M24
        │
        ▼
     Klipper streams the file
        │
        ├─ a bare `T2` ─────► the fork raises a flag and WAITS for the app
        │                     to perform the change
        └─ pause / resume / cancel ─► the app sends each sequence itself
```

**Reforge, driven by whatever you like:**

```
Mainsail, HelixScreen, OrcaSlicer — anything that speaks Moonraker
  │
  └─ [ff_print] wraps SDCARD_PRINT_FILE and M23
        │   reads bed, nozzle, first tool, used tools and first-layer height
        │   from the file
        │
        ├─ FF_BEFORE_PRINT_START ─┬─► _FF_PREFLIGHT  calibration + tool gate
        │                         └─► START_PRINT    the preparation sequence
        ▼
     Klipper streams the file
        │
        ├─ a bare `T2` ─────► ff_toolchange performs the change
        └─ PAUSE / RESUME / CANCEL_PRINT ─► macros in ff-print-macros.cfg
        │
        ▼
     FF_AFTER_PRINT_END ──► END_PRINT   the exit block
```

The shape is the same. The difference is that every box in the second diagram
is a Klipper macro or a Klipper extra, and every box in the first was inside
one binary.

Step by step, with the app's own sequence, the fork code that makes a
Mainsail print hang, and what `START_PRINT` actually sends:
[The print pipeline](print-pipeline.md).

## Changing what it does

Everything below goes at the **end of your `printer.cfg`**, restating only
what you are changing. Klipper merges same-named sections and the last value
wins, so the shipped defaults stay for everything you leave out, and your
overrides survive every update. Never edit the `ff-*.cfg` files themselves —
an update replaces them without asking.

### Turn off the automatic preparation

If your own profile already calls `START_PRINT`, or homes for itself:

```ini
[gcode_macro FF_BEFORE_PRINT_START]
variable_prepare: 0
```

Preparing twice misplaces nothing — the Z offset and `T<n>` are both
idempotent — but it re-homes and re-purges every tool for no reason. A
profile that runs its own `G28` **needs** this off: our `G28` docks a mounted
tool before homing Z, so it would dock the tool preparation just grabbed and
print with an empty carriage.

### Drive the sequence from the slicer

With `prepare: 0`, call it yourself from Machine start G-code:

```gcode
START_PRINT TOOLS=0:220,2:240 BED=60 LEVEL=1 SOAK=300
```

| Parameter | Does |
|---|---|
| `TOOLS=0:220,2:240` | every tool the file uses, with its clean temperature. A bare `TOOLS=0,2` also works |
| `BED=`, `NOZZLE=`, `LAYER=` | the print's bed, nozzle and first-layer height |
| `CLEAN=0` | skip the pre-print purge and wipe |
| `LEVEL=1` | probe a fresh mesh instead of loading the saved one |
| `SOAK=<seconds>` | dwell after the bed reaches target. The app waited 5 minutes; the default here is 0 |

## Where to read the real thing

The macros are on the printer at `/usr/data/anvil-data/config/ff-print-macros.cfg`, and
in this repo at
[`pkgs/klipper-config/payload/config/ff-print-macros.cfg`](../pkgs/klipper-config/payload/config/ff-print-macros.cfg).
They are ordinary Klipper macros with comments explaining why each step is
what it is.

The app's own sequences, recovered from the binary with addresses, are in
[Print lifecycle](notes/50-print-lifecycle.md), and the fuller division of
labour between application and Klipper is
[firmwareExe vs Klipper](notes/25-app-vs-klipper-ownership.md).
