# The pin is a tag and GitHub strips its leading "v" from that directory name,
# which ${MOONRAKER_VERSION#v} undoes.
# The unpack keeps the wrapper and the stage reaches through it, rather than
# --strip-components hiding the archive's shape from whoever reads this.
#
# tests/ is a sizeable part of the tree and never runs on a printer, so it is
# trimmed here, once, on the way in.
