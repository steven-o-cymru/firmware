# THE .so IS BUILT FROM THE TREE THAT SHIPS, and that is the whole reason this
# recipe compiles anything rather than shipping a prebuilt object. cffi
# resolves symbols LAZILY, so a c_helper.so built from older sources than the
# klippy beside it imports cleanly, passes an ABI check, installs, boots --
# and dies at "Unhandled exception during connect" on the printer. That
# happened: a .so built four days before kin_extruder.c gained
# extruder_stepper_free shipped and bricked klippy startup on hardware. One
# source verb means one tree, so the failure is unrepresentable here.
#
# NO CACHE OF ITS OWN. bin/payload.sh kept a $FORK/.version stamp and an
# `is the .so older than any .c` mtime test, both of which pkg_begin's stamp
# replaces -- the stamp is the pinned commit and the toolchain filename, so a
# bump to either rebuilds and nothing else does.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- no gate here
# This recipe checks nothing about the object it just built, and both halves of
# what used to be here left for a reason.
#
# THE ABI -- o32/nan2008/mips32r2, which the kernel answers with ENOEXEC -- is
# asked once now, of the installed filesystem, in qa/replica/test_abi.py. That
# covers both vehicles this tree travels on (the package and the SOFTWARE component
# bin/payload.sh stages) rather than only the one a build.sh can see.
#
# THE SYMBOLS -- every function klippy cdefs, against the .so's dynamic symbol
# table -- went with the test/ tree. cffi resolves lazily, so a .so built from
# older sources than the klippy beside it imports cleanly and dies on the
# printer at connect; that is the failure described at the top of this file.
# What keeps it out is no longer a check but the shape of the recipe: the .so is
# compiled from the chelper sources of the very tree it is about to ship, so a
# .so older than its klippy is not something this build can produce.
